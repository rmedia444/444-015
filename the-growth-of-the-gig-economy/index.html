                    The gig economy was expanding rapidly in 2010, driven by digital platforms that connected freelancers with short-term work opportunities. Companies like Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit facilitated flexible work arrangements, allowing individuals to monetize their skills and assets. This shift was transforming traditional employment models and offering new ways for people to earn income.

                    While the gig economy provided flexibility and independence, it also raised questions about job security, benefits, and worker protections. The growth of this sector highlighted the need for updated labor policies to address the changing nature of work in the digital age.
