                    Personalized medicine was gaining momentum in 2010, aiming to tailor medical treatments to individual patients based on their genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Advances in genomics and molecular diagnostics enabled more precise identification of disease mechanisms and the development of targeted therapies. This approach promised to improve treatment efficacy and reduce adverse effects.
